Unlike other technologies that leverage only one kind of AMM logic - fixed & static, Balancer V2 has been designed to be modular and flexible, allowing users to access a one-stop shop for liquidity provision. 

### <p align="center"> How does it work? </p>

Balancer is based on an N-dimensional invariant surface which is a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin and proven viable by the popular Uniswap dapp.

While other exchanges have pools with constrained parameters, Balancer V2 Tech can accommodate pools of any composition and underlying math. Balancer allows for anyone to develop their own pool type, opening the door for customized pricing functions in trading pools.

Balancer V2 brings powerful new features such as the Vault and SOR to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital, and open the door to custom AMMs.
